# ToDo List Client
ToDo List Client is a web application written in TypeScript using Vite and React libraries. 
This application serves as a client for the [ToDo List API](https://github.com/mGlok/todo-list-api), which is also created by me.

ToDo List Client allows users to manage their task lists, add new items, delete and edit existing items, and mark tasks as completed.

## To install the application, follow the steps below:

### Installation using Yarn
1. Clone the ToDo List Client repository using the `git clone https://github.com/mGlok/todo-list-client` command.
2. Navigate to the application directory using the cd `todo-list-client` command.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the `yarn` command.

After completing these steps, you can compile the application by running the `yarn build` command. Once the compilation is complete, you can run the application using the `yarn preview` command.

### Installation using npm
1. Clone the ToDo List Client repository using the `git clone https://github.com/mGlok/todo-list-client` command.
2. Navigate to the application directory using the `cd todo-list-client` command.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the `npm install` command.

After completing these steps, you can compile the application by running the `npm run build` command. Once the compilation is complete, you can run the application using the `npm run preview` command.

### Additional Information

It is also worth mentioning that the [ToDo List API](https://github.com/mGlok/todo-list-api), with which ToDo List Client communicates, is created in Node.js using Express.js and Postgres SQL, and the API code is also written in TypeScript.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
